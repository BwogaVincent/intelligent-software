For our malaria outbreak platform, AI testing ensures critical login functionality works reliably across different user roles (health workers, administrators, researchers). The AI automatically adapts tests as we add multi-factor authentication or localization for African languages. This robust automated validation is essential for a system handling sensitive health data during outbreaks, where system reliability can impact life-saving interventions.
