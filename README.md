For our malaria outbreak platform, AI testing ensures critical login functionality works reliably across different user roles (health workers, administrators, researchers). The AI automatically adapts tests as we add multi-factor authentication or localization for African languages. This robust automated validation is essential for a system handling sensitive health data during outbreaks, where system reliability can impact life-saving interventions.
AI-Powered Malaria Eradication System
This demo presents a web-based intelligent software system designed to combat malaria in Africa. It integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and mobile technology to improve surveillance, vector control, and treatment distribution.

The system features an AI-driven dashboard built with React, which identifies malaria transmission hotspots using simulated data from satellite imagery and epidemiological information. It provides real-time surveillance of malaria cases, mosquito density, and risk levels, facilitating rapid decision-making. The dashboard also tracks interventions like larviciding and insecticide-treated net distribution.

While the mobile app isn't implemented in this demo, the system is designed for mobile integration, allowing field workers to report cases and receive AI-guided instructions. The scalable interface, built with React and Tailwind CSS, is suitable for deployment across African health systems. Users can interact with the demo by opening the HTML file and clicking on hotspots for detailed information and AI-recommended actions. A full implementation would connect to a backend API for live data and integrate with GIS and mobile tools
